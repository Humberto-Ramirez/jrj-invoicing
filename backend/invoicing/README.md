# JRJ Invoicing

FastApi project for JRJ Construction invoices.

## Requirements

* [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org)
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for Python package and dependency management.

## Local Development

By default, the dependencies are managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), go there and install it.

You can install all the dependencies with:

```console
poetry install
```

Then you can start a shell session with the new environment with:

```console
poetry shell
```

Next, open your editor at project root: `./`, so that you see an `./src/jrj_invoicing` directory with your code inside.
That way, your editor will be able to find all the imports, etc. Make sure your editor uses the environment you just
created with Poetry.

## Testing

To test the project run:

```console
pytest
```
